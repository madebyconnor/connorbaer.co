# Connor Bär 🐼

Hi, I'm Connor! I enjoy life as a web developer and machine learning engineer. Problem solving is my passion. [Say hi](https://twitter.com/connor_baer)!

[This is my website](https://connorbaer.co). It's built with [CraftCMS](https://craftcms.com) and a lot of ❤️.

## Getting started

1. [Download](https://github.com/connor-baer/connorbaer.co/archive/master.zip) or clone the repository.
2. Duplicate the `example.env.sh` file in the scripts directory, and rename it to `.env.sh`. Then open up the `.env.sh` file into your favorite editor, and replace `REPLACE_ME` with the appropriate settings. Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-scripts).
3. Run the install script from the command line: `./install_craft.sh`. This will download [CraftCMS](https://craftcms.com), move all necessary files into place and set the appropriate permissions.
4. Follow the CraftCMS [installation instructions](https://craftcms.com/docs/installing) **starting at step 3**. We've already completed the first two steps.
5. You're all set. Enjoy!
