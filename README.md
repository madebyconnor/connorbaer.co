# Connor Bär 🐼

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/connor-baer/connorbaer.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Hi, I'm Connor! I enjoy life as a web developer and machine learning engineer. Problem solving is my passion. [Say hi](https://twitter.com/connor_baer)!

[This is my website](https://connorbaer.co). It's built with [CraftCMS](https://craftcms.com) and a lot of 💜.

## Getting started

1. [Download](https://github.com/connor-baer/connorbaer.co/archive/master.zip) or clone the repository.
3. Follow the CraftCMS [installation instructions](https://github.com/craftcms/docs/blob/master/en/installation.md) **skipping step 2**. This repository already contains all necessary files, simply run `composer update` to get going.
4. Bonus: I've included [nystudio107](https://github.com/nystudio107/)'s handy [Craft scripts](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft-scripts). To use them, duplicate the `example.env.sh` file in the scripts directory, and rename it to `.env.sh`. Then open up the `.env.sh` file in your favorite editor, and replace `REPLACE_ME` with the appropriate settings.
5. You're all set. Enjoy!
