{#

 # The site layout template
 # ------------------------
 #
 # This layout template extends the _layouts/base.html layout, and defines the
 # main site layout: the header, footer, and main content area.
 #
 # Itâ€™s never accessed directly. Instead it is extended by all of our main site
 # templates.
 #
 # This template defines one block region, `main`, which should be extended by
 # child templates to define the main contents for the page.
